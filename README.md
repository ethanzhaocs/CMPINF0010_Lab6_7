What this code does: 
The code gives a prompt for your name and favorite number and then prints out your name and favorite number

For the license, we used that license because the software doesn't actually do anything and its free to use. For why we are using the specific outline for the code of conduct, it's because the program is simple and any edits are welcome. We only ask that the user is respectful and adheres to typical moral and ethical behavior.
